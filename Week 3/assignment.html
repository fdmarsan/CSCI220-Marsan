        <h1> Experiment of the Effects of Caffeine on GPA </h1>
        <h2> Conducted by Jennifer (who works in a lab) </h2>
        <hr/>
        <p> This experiment seeks to determine if a correlation exists between the amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine" target="_blank"> caffeine </a> an individual consumes daily and that individual's grade point average <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_in_education" target="_blank"> (GPA)  </a>in school.
            <p> 100 students were assigned numbers from 1-100 and were chosen at random into three groups: </p>
           <ul> 
               <li><b> Group A:</b> received caffeine equivalent to the national average (3 cups)</li>
               <li> <b> Group B: </b>  received twice the amount of the national daily average (6 cups)</li> 
               <li> <b> Group C: </b>  recieved a placebo (control group)</li>
           </ul>
        <p> Steps followed to produce results: </p>
        <ol> 
            <li> 100 students selected from volunteer applicants between the ages of 18-22 years old. Equal numbers of female and male participants with a starting GPA between 3.2 and 3.3</li>
            <li> Each student assigned a number from 1-100</li>
            <li> Numbers were randomly selected and assigned to groups A, B, and C </li>
            <li> Group A was given 3 cups of coffee per day (the national average) </li>
            <li> Group B was given 6 cups of coffee per day </li>
            <li> Group C was given a placebo </li>
            <li> Grade Point Averages were tracked throughout the term and averaged by group at the <b> start </b> of the <b> semester </b>, at <b> midterm </b>, and after <b> final grades</b> were submitted. </li>
        </ol>

              <!-- Dr.Hopper, I feel like this would be a fun way for me to express my thoughts on this assignment as well as this class. 
                I had a lot of trouble understanding what was going on last semester during my programming class and honestly I can't tell you if I had learned anything.
                It was possibly the hardest class I have ever taken. And that only worries me as I continue pursuing a minor in computer science.
                I am worried that it will become too overwhelming as I simply have never done any programming work nor have I ever had the interest in wondering how it all works. 
                But I am hopeful that this semester is different. I think that if I do learn and retain the skills I learn in this class that it would be beneficial for me and actually quite fun.
                I just advise to be patient with me as this is really hard for my brain to grasp and understand exactly what it is that I am doing. 
                I felt too stupid to ask questions last semester, but this semester I will be asking you lots of questions. Thank you :)
                ps: the fact that I made this comment as well as completed the assignment (I hope) and understood how to do it and actually execute it is exciting for me. 
            -->
